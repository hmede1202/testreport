<body><p><strong><em>Hi Everyone!</em></strong><p>
  <p>&amp; Hello world. This is my first website!</p>
<p>My name is Hunter Mede.<p>
<p>I live in California and I'm a junior at <a href= "https://www.smuhsd.org/burlingamehigh" title="My High School" target="_blank">Burlingame HS</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first website, so I'm reading the MDN link on our syllabus to learn how I can tweak my site by adding different attributes to it.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to learning as much as I can!<p>
