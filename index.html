<body><p><strong><em>Hi Everyone!</em></strong><p>
<p>My name is Hunter Mede.<p>
<p>I live in California and I'm a junior at <a href= "https://www.smuhsd.org/burlingamehigh" title="My High School" target="_blank">Burlingame HS</a>.</p>
<p>This is my first website, so I'm reading the MDN link on our syllabus to learn how I can tweak my site to include different attributes.<p>
<p>Looking forward to learning as much as I can in this class.<p>
